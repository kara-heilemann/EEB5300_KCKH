## **Overview**
  
  Tapeworms are obligate parasites that infect a variety of hosts globally.  Larval tapeworm infections can particularly effect people in developing countries.  In 2015, the larval form of cystic echinococcosis resulted in an estimated 126,800 years lost to disability (Webb et al.,  2017).  Similarly, tapeworms can also affect animals.  For example, these parasites were shown to provide a production challenge for cattle raisers in Belgium as illustrated in a study conducted from 2012-2016.  Here, Bovine cysticercosis caused by the Taenia saginata tapeworm was shown to occur in approximately 1,183 carcasses yearly which resulted in a loss of $4,043,126 for cattle farmers per year (Jensen et al., 2018).The economic impact of this loss in revenue and product greatly affected cattle farmers and consumers alike.
  
  Cestodes, class Cestoda, are tapeworms that are especially unique in their ability to infect different organisms throughout their lifecycle.  They often parasitize one or more animals in their larval stage, known as an intermediate host, and eventually the tapeworms take up residence in a different animal during the adult stage, known as a definitive host (Webb et al., 2017).  Tetraphyllidea is an order of tapeworms, subclass Eucestoda, class Cestoda, and members of this order live in the intestines of their vertebrate definitive hosts.  
  
  Since Tetraphyllidea larva generally lack distinct morphological features, Tetraphyllidea are characterized by traits exhibited by the adult tapeworms.  Adult species of the order Tetraphyllidea are identified by their anterior head region, or scolex, followed by a germinative region, or neck.  For most tapeworms of the order Tetraphyllidea, the head contains four muscular structures or bothridia which aid the tapeworm in attaching to the hostâ€™s intestinal mucosa (Healy, 2006).  The neck serves as a site of cell proliferation and it produces proglottids or individual reproductive units that contain all of the sexual organs required to produce eggs (Caira et al., 1999).   
  
  Tetraphyllidea is the largest order of Cestoda, boasting some 500 described species (Caira et al., 2005).  These endoparasites are renowned for the great degree of host specificity they exhibit as these tapeworms are known to solely infect sharks, skates and rays.  However, the true biodiversity of these tapeworms remains unknown as the current count of tapeworm species is approximately 5,000 while there is an estimated 20,000 species worldwide (Caira & Jensen, 2017).
